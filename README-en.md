## Introduction

A [UserScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamfugui/youtube-adb/main/index.user.js) for removing YouTube ads. Supports both desktop and mobile versions.

For desktop, it is recommended to install using [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
For Android, it is recommended to install using [Via Browser](https://viayoo.com/); iOS users can try on their own.

The code has been synchronized to [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/459541-youtube-adb).

## Note

YouTube handles different users differently. If you cannot use the script properly, it means it may not be suitable for you.
